Whitelist Dapp is a web3 project that deals with how whitelists works for NFT projects in the web3 space.

The website has a connect wallet functionality that a user can use to connect to MetaMask or any web3 wallet extension.

If your wallet address is whitelisted, you can mint the NFT, if it's not whitelisted, you will have to wait for public mint.

The full functionality of the website hasn't yet been implemented. I hope to work on that as time goes on.

To run the project;

Open your terminal on your code editor(Preferably VS CODE)

Cd into the my-app folder

type npm run dev

And open the link on your browser.
